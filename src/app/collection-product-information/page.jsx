            We are Vinjournalen.se, a leading Swedish wine magazine online with more than 120,000 unique readers monthly! Currently, we are building a complete online wine guide to the Swedish market. The guides are already very appreciated by Swedish wine consumers. Products that we present in the guide are also used in editorial content and can also be placed below article content as featured products.

            We have some basic details about the product collected today from online sources. More information, however, will help our visitors to better understand your wine and also be interested to read more about other wines from you as a producer or importer.

            Thanks in advance for your help to let us present your product in the very best way online.
